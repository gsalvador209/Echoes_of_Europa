 <h1  align="center">Echoes of Europa</h1>

## 🚩 Overview

Echoes of Europa is an educational and technical showcase developed using Unity and Blender, exploring the unique terrain of Jupiter's moon, Europa. The project demonstrates advanced implementations of physics simulations, 3D modeling, and shader development through interactive environments.

### 🎮 Gameplay Experience

This first-person exploration provides an educational journey through distinct ecosystems on Europa:

Engage in dynamic physics-based interactions.

Explore educational content detailing Europa's geology and potential habitability.

Interact with realistic simulations of fluid dynamics, cloth movement, rigid objects, and soft body deformation.


### 💡 Key Technical Features

Advanced 3D Modeling: Utilizes geometric, hierarchical, mechanical, organic, and physics-based modeling techniques in Blender.

Physics Simulations: Leveraging NVIDIA Flex, including:

Water dynamics in ponds and droplets.

Cloth behavior for realistic flag movements.

Rigid and deformable object interactions, exemplified by rocks and mushrooms.

Custom Shader Development: ShaderLab scripts for realistic planetary gradients and ocean waves.

Real-time Animations: Integrated with Unity's Input System package for responsive and natural avatar movements.

Immersive Camera and Lighting: First-person camera setups with dynamic rotation and adaptive lighting for atmospheric realism.

### 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

- Unity 2022.3: Core engine for simulation, real-time interactions, and rendering.
- Blender 3.5: Modeling and structural layout for all scene components.
- ShaderLab: Custom shader scripts for visual effects and interactions.
- C#: Scripting for physics, interactions, and animation logic.
- NVIDIA Flex: Integration for advanced particle-based physical simulations.
